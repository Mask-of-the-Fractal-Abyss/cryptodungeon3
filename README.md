# cryptodungeon3
This is a multiplayer text game. The finished product will allow participants to pass a .txt or .db file to each other (like chess notation!). Some of the secret data will only visible to one player (or neither player!). This game additionally has an interesting type of territory/land claiming system which is objectively similar to cryptocurrency. When the program is first run, thousands of rooms are generated, along with their corresponding randomly generated code.

The room can only be accessed by knowing the code, and the code can only be found by repeatedly typing in codes into the game, until one is successful. In this way room keys are like a virtual currency, since knowing more of them gives you access to more board space, resources, and more monsters to battle! Eventually, after players accumulate enough rooms, they will be able to automate that process and expand exponentially. Then they will be able to find the other player in the hundreds of rooms and kill them, ending the game!
